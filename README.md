## Description

This is my portfolio of the web applications that I have worked on by myself and as a team. Snaccidental Recipe and Poggers were team projects and Note Taker was an independent application. There is a link to my resume for future employers and other ways to contact me as well.

## Usage

Upload the HTML index file and assets folder. The assets folder contains the links and images for the website or go to the live deployed link.
